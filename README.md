2) Artist View - Brought up by clicking on artist from Search View - displays all releases from that artist.
        -Should have cover art from link.
        -Allow paging through releases.

3) Release View - Brought up by clicking on the artist view - displays the list of songs/recordings?

4) Song View - Brought up by clicking on the song from Release View - displays lyrics to the song.
